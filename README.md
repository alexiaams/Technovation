# ResqFood – Technovation Girls Project 2023

## 🌐 Technovation Girls
[Technovation Girls](https://technovationchallenge.org/) is a global program created **specifically for girls** to encourage them to explore STEM fields by building technology solutions to real-world problems.

## 📋 Overview
ResqFood is a mobile application developed for the **Technovation Girls 2023** competition.  
Our mission: **reduce food waste** by connecting food providers with customers and offering products close to their expiration date at a progressive discount.

The project was built from the ground up by a team of four high-school students.  
We created both the **mobile application** and a complete **business plan**, and we proudly reached the **Quarterfinals** of this international competition.
